# Hermes

Hermes is a simple toy neural network library implemented in Rust. It is designed for educational purposes and provides basic functionality to create, train, and evaluate neural networks. This library is not intended for production use but serves as a learning tool for those interested in understanding the fundamentals of neural networks and their implementation.

## Features

- Basic neural network operations
- Tensor manipulation
- Support for custom layers and operations
- Lightweight and easy to understand

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Installation

To use Hermes, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
hermes = { path = "path/to/hermes" }
```

### Usage

Here is a simple example to get you started with Hermes:

```rust
use hermes::model::Model;
use hermes::tensor::Tensor;
use hermes::operation::Operation;

fn main() {
    // Create a simple neural network
    let model = Model::new();

    // Define input tensor
    let input = Tensor::new(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);

    // Perform a forward pass
    let output = model.forward(input);

    // Print the output
    println!("{:?}", output);
}
```

## Modules
